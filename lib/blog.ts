    content: `Discovering your design style is extremely helpful when building a home, redesigning a space, or simply providing direction when working with an interior designer. While rarely does someone fit into a single design style, understanding your tastes and preferences can help guide you through the decision-making process so you can fall in love with your dream space.

Today we're covering a few ways to get inspired and discover your own unique design style.

Before we dive in, don't be worried if your preferences and tastes aren't "in" right now. Trends come and go all the time. While loving what's coming across your Instagram feed is completely okay, design should be a process of self-discovery. We want you to invest in pieces you will treasure in years to come. Learn to trust your instincts.

## #1 Reflect on Your Natural Tastes

First, start by reflecting on your own unique tastes. Take a moment to appreciate the parts of your life that uplift and inspire you, without the pressure or influence of the internet. What do you love? How do you like to use your home? Does it serve as a place of gathering and entertainment? Or do you like to keep things cozy and peaceful?

Remember, your home is a reflection of who you are. It becomes a representation of your values and interests.

A simple exercise is to think of feelings or words you would want to describe your home. Do you want it to be cozy, clean, or inviting? How about grand, elegant, or loud? Try identifying the colors, patterns, and materials in your home that you already love.

Don't be afraid to take a few cues from your closet either. What else represents your personal style more than your wardrobe? Think of the outfits you're drawn to most. Do you see a lot of patterns and bold colors? Or are they mostly made up of neutrals?

## #2 Find Inspiration from Others

Once you have a clear grasp of your preferences, it's time to look elsewhere for some additional inspiration. Go ahead and browse through Pinterest, home-style magazines, or some of the more popular design shows. What jumps out at you? What projects seem to complement your tastes? As you are looking, save the ideas you love.

It's also helpful to consider the places you visit. Whether a distant travel destination or simply a friend's home, pay attention to the unique feeling each space inspires. What have they done to create that feeling?

Looking over your research and what inspires you, you'll start to see some similarities. You might even find a trend begins to emerge—one that's entirely unique to you.

## #3 Match it with a Design Style

With your research and inspiration gathered, try matching your style to some of the more common design styles. Designers use these to help focus in on a design direction because they are familiar and easy to reference but remember that these are only meant to begin the conversation. You don't have to, and won't likely, identify with any single style. It's perfectly natural to incorporate elements from multiple design concepts into your own.

## Design Styles Reference Guide

### Traditional
Classic details, elegant, timeless, layers of color and texture.

### Modern
Straight edges, geometric shapes, high-contrast and neutrals.

### Contemporary
Soft and simple lines, curved details, natural materials, natural light. Similar to Modern but more feminine with details and layers of texture.

### Transitional

### Industrial
Raw and rough materials with modern elements. Exposure of concrete, ceiling beams, brick, HVAC, etc.

### Country & Farmhouse
Cozy, clean, rustic, vintage vibes. Soft and neutral colors are common.

### Minimalism
Simplicity, clean lines, monochromatic palette, "less is more", natural light.

    content: `It's no surprise that St. George, Utah, has become a beloved place to live with its beautiful views, amazing weather (except for those intense summers), and surrounding state parks. Beyond that, St. George has much to offer from a design and architectural perspective.

Today we're diving deep into the heart of St. George, exploring its distinctive qualities, and highlighting noteworthy aspects for your future design endeavors. Whether you're considering building a home or starting a remodel in the area, we hope this can serve as a resource and guide to all this city offers.

## Natural Elements

With St. George's unique lava rock, red mountains, and desert landscape, it only makes sense that the homes uniquely share these natural elements. Incorporating the surrounding rock and colors in the exterior landscapes and home surfaces is always a favorable choice when designing your home.

Even though the homes featured below are entirely different styles and were built over 150 years apart, incorporating the natural landscape serves as a timeless look as it complements the surrounding area.

## Historic St. George

One of the most charming features of St. George is the historic architecture. While strolling down Main Street, you can find shops, restaurants, museums, and churches within the classic historic homes and buildings.

While admiring the historic homes, you'll often find traditional elements in the structure with European details due to the rich heritage of those who originally lived there.

### Areas to Explore:
- Ancestor Square
- Green Gate Village
- Townsquare
- Main Street Santa Clara

We love seeing the bright red sandstone in all the original buildings on main street square. The classical corbels and medallions on the Tabernacle bring character and detail. Even the crafted stone headers above the windows bring depth and texture.

## Developing Areas

Whether you want to live in a secluded area surrounded by nature or a lively neighborhood for family life, Southern Utah offers something for everyone.
