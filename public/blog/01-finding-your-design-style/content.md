## Introduction

Discovering your design style is extremely helpful when building a home, redesigning a space, or simply providing direction when working with an interior designer. While rarely does someone fit into a single design style, understanding your tastes and preferences can help guide you through the decision-making process so you can fall in love with your dream space.

Today we're covering a few ways to get inspired and discover your own unique design style.

Before we dive in, don't be worried if your preferences and tastes aren't "in" right now. Trends come and go all the time. While loving what's coming across your Instagram feed is completely okay, design should be a process of self-discovery. We want you to invest in pieces you will treasure in years to come. Learn to trust your instincts.

## #1 Reflect on Your Natural Tastes

First, start by reflecting on your own unique tastes. Take a moment to appreciate the parts of your life that uplift and inspire you, without the pressure or influence of the internet. What do you love? How do you like to use your home? Does it serve as a place of gathering and entertainment? Or do you like to keep things cozy and peaceful?

Remember, your home is a reflection of who you are. It becomes a representation of your values and interests.

A simple exercise is to think of feelings or words you would want to describe your home. Do you want it to be cozy, clean, or inviting? How about grand, elegant, or loud? Try identifying the colors, patterns, and materials in your home that you already love. What feelings or words would you use to describe them?

Don't be afraid to take a few cues from your closet either. What else represents your personal style more than your wardrobe? Think of the outfits you're drawn to most. Do you see a lot of patterns and bold colors? Or are they mostly made up of neutrals? If your home was an outfit, what could you never get rid of?

## #2 Find Inspiration from Others

Once you have a clear grasp of your preferences, it's time to look elsewhere for some additional inspiration. Go ahead and browse through Pinterest, home-style magazines, or some of the more popular design shows. What jumps out at you? What projects seem to complement your tastes? As you are looking, save the ideas you love.

It's also helpful to consider the places you visit. Whether a distant travel destination or simply a friend's home, pay attention to the unique feeling each space inspires. What have they done to create that feeling?

Looking over your research and what inspires you, you'll start to see some similarities. You might even find a trend begins to emerge—one that's entirely unique to you.

## #3 Match it with a Design Style

With your research and inspiration gathered, try matching your style to some of the more common design styles (we've shared a list below with examples to make it even easier). Designers use these to help focus in on a design direction because they are familiar and easy to reference but remember that these are only meant to begin the conversation. You don't have to, and won't likely, identify with any single style. It's perfectly natural to incorporate elements from multiple design concepts into your own.

And your designer should be perfectly willing to work with your tastes. That's what cultivating a home is all about! Together you can refine your vision to something truly unique and personalized to you and your lifestyle—a truly bespoke design.
