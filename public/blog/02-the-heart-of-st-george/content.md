## Introduction

It's no surprise that St. George, Utah, has become a beloved place to live with its beautiful views, amazing weather (except for those intense summers), and surrounding state parks. Beyond that, St. George has much to offer from a design and architectural perspective.

Today we're diving deep into the heart of St. George, exploring its distinctive qualities, and highlighting noteworthy aspects for your future design endeavors. Whether you're considering building a home or starting a remodel in the area, we hope this can serve as a resource and guide to all this city offers.

## Natural Elements

With St. George's unique lava rock, red mountains, and desert landscape, it only makes sense that the homes uniquely share these natural elements. Incorporating the surrounding rock and colors in the exterior landscapes and home surfaces is always a favorable choice when designing your home.

Even though the homes featured below are entirely different styles and were built over 150 years apart, incorporating the natural landscape serves as a timeless look as it complements the surrounding area.

## Historic St. George

One of the most charming features of St. George is the historic architecture. While strolling down Main Street, you can find shops, restaurants, museums, and churches within the classic historic homes and buildings.

While admiring the historic homes, you'll often find traditional elements in the structure with European details due to the rich heritage of those who originally lived there.

### Areas to Explore:
- Ancestor Square
- Green Gate Village
- Townsquare
- Main Street Santa Clara

We love seeing the bright red sandstone in all the original buildings on main street square. You'll notice the classical corbels and medallions on the Tabernacle that bring character and detail. Even the crafted stone headers above the windows bring depth and texture. Just like with any home, building, or space, the craftsmanship and fine details truly elevate the overall appearance.
